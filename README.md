## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🌾 Crop Predictor  
Recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on:
- Soil nutrients (N, P, K)
- pH and organic content
- Regional climate patterns
- Historical crop performance

### 💧 Irrigation Scheduler  
Automates irrigation planning using:
- Soil moisture levels
- Crop type and water requirements
- Local weather forecasts

### 🚰 Water Usage Optimizer  
Reduces water consumption by:
- Predicting optimal irrigation volume
- Learning from usage history
- Adapting to seasonal and crop-specific variations

### 📈 Water Level Predictor  
Forecasts water levels in storage units such as:
- Farm tanks
- Reservoirs
- Canals  
Using rainfall, consumption, and environmental data

### 🌿 Soil Analyzer  
Evaluates soil quality through:
- Nutrient analysis (NPK)
- pH value, moisture content, and EC
- Classification for crop suitability
