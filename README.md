## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/2fd54993-ca3c-4812-b22d-9903205238e3) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System for Precision Farming

**FarmGaze** is an intelligent machine learning–based platform designed to support precision farming through real-time analytics, crop recommendations, optimized irrigation, and environmental monitoring. It aims to improve productivity, conserve water, and assist farmers in making data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system integrates multiple ML models, weather forecasting, geospatial mapping, and interactive visualizations to build a smarter irrigation framework tailored for precision agriculture.

---

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🌾 Crop Predictor  
Recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on:
- Soil nutrients (N, P, K)
- pH and organic content
- Regional climate patterns
- Historical crop performance

### 💧 Irrigation Scheduler  
Automates irrigation planning using:
- Soil moisture levels
- Crop type and water requirements
- Local weather forecasts

### 🚰 Water Usage Optimizer  
Reduces water consumption by:
- Predicting optimal irrigation volume
- Learning from usage history
- Adapting to seasonal and crop-specific variations

### 📈 Water Level Predictor  
Forecasts water levels in storage units such as:
- Farm tanks
- Reservoirs
- Canals  
Using rainfall, consumption, and environmental data

### 🌿 Soil Analyzer  
Evaluates soil quality through:
- Nutrient analysis (NPK)
- pH value, moisture content, and EC
- Classification for crop suitability

---

## 🌦️ Weather Forecaster

Provides real-time and predictive weather data essential for:
- Irrigation decisions
- Pest/disease risk analysis
- Seasonal crop planning

Key data points include:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Rainfall probability
- Wind speed
- Solar radiation

---

## 🗺️ Interactive Mapping Tools

Includes geospatial visualizations for:
- Soil and crop distribution
- Water-stressed regions
- Vegetation health (NDVI)
- Weather overlay on maps

---

## 📊 Visualization Dashboard

A user-friendly dashboard that displays:
- Model predictions and results
- Crop growth trends
- Irrigation schedules
- Historical analytics
- Resource usage summaries

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow  
- **Web Frameworks:** Flask or FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optionally React)  
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Dash, Chart.js  
- **Geo Mapping:** Leaflet.js, Google Maps API, GeoPandas  
- **Database:** SQLite, Firebase, or MongoDB

---

## 📁 Project Structure (Simplified)

- `models/` – All ML models (crop predictor, irrigation, etc.)  
- `weather/` – Weather forecast integration  
- `maps/` – Geospatial mapping tools  
- `visualizations/` – Dashboards and charts  
- `templates/` – HTML frontend pages  
- `static/` – Static assets (CSS, JS)
